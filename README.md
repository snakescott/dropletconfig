Digital Ocean 
=============
The 512MB Ram 20GB SSD Disk 1CPU Droplets are only $5/mo, which is much cheaper than EC2 -- although to be fair DO is also 
significantly more bare bones. If you want to try it out, feel free to use this referral code:

Also, the follow promo code is good for $10 off (that's two months free), although I'm not sure when it expires: OMGSSD10
